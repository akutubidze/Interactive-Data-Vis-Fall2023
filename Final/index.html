        <p>Imagine if every freely accessible public space in New York showcased at least one piece of artwork from the Modern Art Museum of New York. How amazing would that be? To determine the feasibility of this idea, let's delve into the types of artworks within the MoMA collection.
            The MoMA collection boasts nearly 200,000 works of modern and contemporary art by artists from around the world, encompassing various categories and mediums. The visual representation below provides evidence of the classification of artworks by categories.</p>

    <p>The New York City Department of City Planning has compiled a database of Privately Owned Public Spaces (POPS) across the five boroughs. This database includes information about legally required amenities for each development, with Artwork being one of the specified attributes among others.<br>
        Explore the locations of POPS across the city below. Utilize the drop-down menu to sort public spaces based on the city's requirement for including Artwork as one of the distinctive features.
        <br><br>
        If an agreement could be reached among MoMA, the city, and developer, artworks from various categories visualized above could be temporarily placed in corresponding public spaces to enhance the public's exposure to art.</p>
